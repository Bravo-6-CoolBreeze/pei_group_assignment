This repo contains solution and code for PEI Group Interview Assignment

#Assumptions
1) The development was done on a Databricks notebook as instructed.
2) Its assumed that the datasets do not have duplicate data. If they have duplicate data some additional test cases can be added and data ingestion and cleaning will change based on how those duplicates should be handled (additional info required for this case).
